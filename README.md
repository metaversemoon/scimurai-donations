# Scimurai Donations




Scimurai Donations is an educational platform that helps scientists, students, professors, institutions, philanthropists, and people to protect their intellectual ideas through a decentralized and transparent way using blockchain technology to document research paper journeys from start to finish.

The mission of Scimurai Donations is for scientists to take ownership of their works, projects, and ideas through a representation of NFTs that they can fundraise, sell, swap, or rent. Each idea/research paper is represented as an NFT that holds a financial value. The way it works is by a simple process where the user shares their awesome idea within our platform, we generate a Non-Fungible Token, then the user invites people, mentors, experts, and investors, to join his/her project by offering funder benefits and incentives.

We are providing users with the necessary tools and resources allowing Individuals/Institutions to fund scientists' papers to further their research and progress. This creates new opportunities for people to secure their work, project, and ideas as an NFT. As well as gathering funds, contributing to others, and donating money.

## How we built it


Scimurai Donations application makes use of the following software:


- `Mumbai Polygon Network` enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Mumbai Network.
Contract Address: `0x2B4c3874FaB2ff0fF19e063De114A8BF5180ed65`


- `Scroll` enables our application to be a scalable platform with almost gasless transactions. We deployed at
